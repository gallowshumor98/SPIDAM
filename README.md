# Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling Project (SPIDAM)

## Overview

SPIDAM is an interactive data analysis/modeling platform that allows users to visualize audio data using scientific calculations and data visualization tools.

The goal of this platform is to help resolve the problem of voice intelligibility in enclosed spaces that can be disruptive to hearing and learning.

## How To Install

Simply download the .zip file and extract it to your preferred directory.

## How To Use

This platform requires ffmpeg to be installed on your local machine. It can be downloaded here: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

- Open your SPIDAM directory and launch an instance of command line

- Use 'ffmpeg' to run ffmpeg

- Use 'python SPIDAM.py' to launch the platform

- Select the 'Open a File' button

- Locate the file you wish to analyze

- If your file is not a .wav file, the platform will convert it to .wav and save it as a new file in the directory

- A message will show with the path to the file

- Use the buttons to display waveform; high, mid, and low frequencies; a combined graph of the frequencies; and spectrogram

- The 'Alternate' button allows you to swap between the plots of high, mid, and low frequencies without closing the plot window
